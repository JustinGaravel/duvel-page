## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

```zsh
  yarn install

```

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Testing

I have tested this using IE10, 11, Edge, Safari(mobile and desktop), Chrome, and Firefox.

## Known Issues

* Polyfill for smooth scrolling in Safari is likely buggy. While it scrolls the first time, if you click the element again it moves slightly another time.

## Future Improvements

*I'd like to add a hamburger dropdown navigation for all forms of mobile.

*The animations are lacking on desktop so I'd like to improve them.

*Integration of Instagram API.
